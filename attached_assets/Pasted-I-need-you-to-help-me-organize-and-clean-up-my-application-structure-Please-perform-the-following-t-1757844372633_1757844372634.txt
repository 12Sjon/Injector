I need you to help me organize and clean up my application structure. Please perform the following tasks systematically. 1.  **Analysis Phase:** First, analyze the current project structure and identify all modules, files, and directories. 2.  **Cleanup & Removal:** Based on your analysis, identify and prepare to remove: - Unused dependencies in `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, or other manifest files. - Empty, obsolete, or temporary directories (e.g., `old/`, `temp/`, `.bak` files). - Temporary files (like `.tmp`, `.bak`, `.old`). - Duplicate files with different names but the same or highly similar content. - Unused assets (images, styles, scripts) that are not imported anywhere. 3.  **Consolidation:** Identify and plan to consolidate duplicate functionality: - Find files with different names but similar purposes (e.g., `utils.js` and `helpers.js` both exporting a `formatDate` function). - Detect code duplication across modules. - Suggest which files should be merged or refactored for clarity and DRYness. 4.  **Reorganization:** Organize the remaining files into a logical, standardized structure. Key categories should include: - `src/database/` or `lib/db/` (for models, schemas, queries, migrations) - `src/ui/` or `src/components/` (for frontend views, components, templates) - `src/services/` or `src/logic/` (for core business logic and service layers) - `src/utils/` (for shared helper functions and tools) - `config/` (for environment variables, settings, and configuration files) - `tests/` or `__tests__/` (for unit and integration tests) 5.  **Critical Validation Step:** After you propose a new structure and *before* finalizing any moves or renames, you MUST: - **Check for import paths:** Analyze all `import`, `require`, and other dependency statements in the code. - **Simulate the move:** Plan the necessary updates to all import paths to reflect the new file locations. - **After organization, explicitly check for and fix any import errors** that would have been broken by the file moves and renames. This is a mandatory requirement to ensure the application remains functional. Please proceed step-by-step.
