# üéØ Bullet Marker Consistency Fix

## Problem Description

When adding new technical points to resumes, the system was using bullet markers (`‚Ä¢`) instead of matching the existing bullet style in the document. For example:

**Before Fix:**
```
Existing points in resume:  ‚Äì Lead modernization projects...
                          ‚Äì Designed and developed...
New points added:         ‚Ä¢ Built distributed applications...
                         ‚Ä¢ Developed complex queries...
```

**After Fix:**
```
Existing points in resume:  ‚Äì Lead modernization projects...
                          ‚Äì Designed and developed...
New points added:         ‚Äì Built distributed applications...
                         ‚Äì Developed complex queries...
```

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the bullet marker detection and application logic in `core/document_processor.py`:

1. **Priority System**: The `_extract_bullet_marker()` method had a priority system that favored standard bullets (`‚Ä¢`) over dashes (`-`, `‚Äì`)
2. **Limited Dash Support**: Only supported basic hyphen-minus (`-`) but not en-dash (`‚Äì`) which is commonly used in professional resumes  
3. **Fallback Behavior**: When detection failed, it would default to bullet (`‚Ä¢`) instead of the document's actual format

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Priority Bias
**Before:**
```python
# Prioritized bullets over dashes
priority_markers = ['‚Ä¢', '‚óè', '‚ó¶', '‚ñ™', '‚ñ´', '‚Ä£']
other_markers = ['*', '-'] + self.bullet_markers
```

**After:**
```python
# Respect what's actually in the document
all_markers = ['‚Ä¢', '‚óè', '‚ó¶', '‚ñ™', '‚ñ´', '‚Ä£', '*'] + self.dash_variants + self.bullet_markers
```

### 2. Added Support for Dash Variants
```python
# Include various dash types commonly used in resumes
self.dash_variants = ['-', '‚Äì', '‚Äî', '-']  # hyphen-minus, en-dash, em-dash, hyphen
```

### 3. Improved Document-wide Detection
```python
def _detect_document_bullet_marker(self, doc: Document) -> str:
    # Use same extraction logic for consistency
    detected_marker = self.formatter._extract_bullet_marker(text)
    # Only count actual markers, not fallbacks
    if detected_marker and detected_marker != '‚Ä¢':
        marker_counts[detected_marker] = marker_counts.get(detected_marker, 0) + 1
```

### 4. Enhanced Text Cleaning
```python
# Clean all possible dash and bullet variants
dash_and_bullet_chars = '-‚Äì‚Äî‚Ä¢‚óè*‚ó¶‚ñ™‚ñ´‚Ä£ \\t'
clean_text = text.lstrip(dash_and_bullet_chars).lstrip()
```

## Test Results

‚úÖ **Test Verification Completed:**
- Correctly detects en-dash (`‚Äì`) in 5/5 test bullets
- Document-wide detection: `‚Äì` (count: 5) 
- Formatting extraction: marker='‚Äì', separator=' '
- No longer defaults to bullet (`‚Ä¢`) when dashes are present

## Files Modified

1. **`core/document_processor.py`**:
   - `BulletFormatter.__init__()` - Added dash variants support
   - `_extract_bullet_marker()` - Removed priority bias
   - `_detect_document_bullet_marker()` - Improved accuracy
   - `_detect_bullet_separator()` - Added dash variants
   - `apply_bullet_formatting()` - Enhanced text cleaning
   - `get_bullet_formatting()` - Better fallback behavior

## Impact

### ‚úÖ Benefits
- **Document Consistency**: New points now match existing bullet style
- **Professional Appearance**: Maintains clean, consistent formatting
- **Universal Support**: Works with bullets (`‚Ä¢`), dashes (`-`, `‚Äì`, `‚Äî`), asterisks (`*`)
- **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects and preserves document format

### üîß Technical Improvements
- More robust bullet marker detection
- Better handling of Unicode dash characters (en-dash, em-dash)
- Improved fallback behavior with document context
- Enhanced logging for debugging

## Usage

The fix is automatic and transparent:

1. **Upload your resume** with existing dash or bullet formatting
2. **Add tech stack points** as normal
3. **New points automatically match** the existing style

No configuration needed - the system will:
- Detect your document's bullet marker style
- Apply the same style to new points
- Preserve spacing and formatting consistency
